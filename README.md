## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to center a div horizontally and vertically using flexbox.

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
 body {
    margin: 0;
    background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
    font-size: 15px;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    height: 100vh;
  }
```
### Continued development

IÂ´m impressed by everything that is possible with flexbox, so I want to keep lerning everything about so I can build complex layouts in the future. 


### Useful resources
